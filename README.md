# hello-world
My first GitHub repository.
Hello, Robert here. I am presently learning to code with aspirations of becoming a web developer. I am studying HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap at www.freecodecamp.com. I will soon be moving on to Javascript. I enjoy coding. I love the feeling I get when I complete a project that I began from scratch.
